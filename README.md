About me: 

I do not consider myself a programmer, although I try to write in different languages, different projects(mainly Minecraft mods).
My name is listed above and so is the return. Yes, I'm born in 2007. You can call me a schoolboy, although in a year I will be graduating.
My first translation was the Occultism mod, cool mod, that's why I decided to translate it.
My first self-written mod was LiaVeres. Basically, textures, I painted alone, including models. The texture of the matter crystal block was made by one person, and the texture of the backpack by another.
